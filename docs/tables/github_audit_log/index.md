# Table: github_audit_log - Query GitHub Audit logs

The `github_audit_log` table allows you to query data from GitHub Audit logs. This table provides detailed information about activity performed within your GitHub account, including the event name, source IP address, user identity, and more.

Currently, the table supports exported logs only in JSON format.

## Configure

Create a [partition](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/partition) for `github_audit_log` ([examples](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/github/tables/github_audit_log#example-configurations)):

```sh
vi ~/.tailpipe/config/github.tpc
```

```hcl
partition "github_audit_log" "my_logs" {
  source "file"  {
    paths       = ["/Users/myuser/github_audit_logs"]
    file_layout = "%{DATA}.json.gz"
  }
}
```

## Collect

[Collect](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/collection) logs for all `github_audit_log` partitions:

```sh
tailpipe collect github_audit_log
```

Or for a single partition:

```sh
tailpipe collect github_audit_log.my_logs
```

## Query

**[Explore 20+ example queries for this table â†’](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/github/queries/github_audit_log)**

### Track enforced branch protection rule changes

Monitors modifications to branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized changes that could compromise repository security and compliance.

```sql
select
  actor,
  actor_ip,
  org
from
  github_audit_log
where
  action in ('repo.protected_branch.update_rule', 'repo.protected_branch.disable_rule')
order by
  created_at desc;
```

### Force pushes against protected branches

Detects force pushes on protected branches to prevent history rewrites, ensuring code integrity and auditability.

```sql
select
  actor,
  action,
  created_at
from
  github_audit_log
where
  action = 'protected_branch.force_push'
order by
  created_at desc;
```

### Repository visibility changed to public

Tracks changes in repository visibility to prevent accidental or unauthorized exposure of sensitive code.

```sql
select
  actor,
  (additional_fields ->> 'visibility') as visibility,
  created_at
from
  github_audit_log
where
  action = 'repo.change_visibility'
  and visibility = 'public'
order by
  created_at desc;
```

### Top 10 actions

List the top 10 actions and how many times they were called.

```sql
select
  action,
  count(*) as action_count
from
  github_audit_log
group by
  action
order by
  action_count desc
limit 10;
```

## Example Configurations

### Collect logs from local files

Collect GitHub audit logs exported locally as JSON.

```hcl
partition "github_audit_log" "audit_log" {
  source "file"  {
    paths       = ["/Users/myuser/github_audit_logs"]
    file_layout = "%{DATA}.json.gz"
  }
}
```

### Exclude read-only events

Use the filter argument in your partition to filter out events like issue comments.

```hcl
partition "github_audit_log" "my_logs_issue_comment" {
  filter = "action ilike '%issue_comment%'"

  source "file"  {
    paths       = ["/Users/myuser/github_audit_logs"]
    file_layout = "%{DATA}.json.gz"
  }
}
```
